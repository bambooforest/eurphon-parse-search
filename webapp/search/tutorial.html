  <h1 id="search-tutorial">Search tutorial</h1>
  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
  <p>Unlike Henning Reetz’s <a href="http://web.phonetik.uni-frankfurt.de/upsid.html">Simple UPSID interface</a>, this
    interface is exclusively text based. This introduces some complexity, but it also makes it possible to go beyond
    rigid search options any fixed interface can offer.</p>
  <p>The query language implemented in the interface contains two basic query types—count queries and comparison
    queries–and allows the user to combine them in a flexible way through logical operators. (If you are comfortable
    with reading CFGs, all you need to know can be found in the very short <a
      href="https://github.com/macleginn/eurphon-parse-search/blob/master/search_grammar.lark">grammar</a>, from which
    the query parser is constructed on the fly using <a href="https://lark-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Lark</a>.)
  </p>
  <p>We will describe the basic queries first and then show how to combine them into more complex ones.</p>
  <h2 id="basic-queries">Basic queries</h2>
  <h3 id="count-queries">Count queries</h3>
  <p>The general form of a count query is <code>operator number features</code> or
    <code>operator number /phoneme/</code>, where
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>operator</code> is one of <code>=, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=</code>,</li>
    <li><code>number</code> is a non-negative integer,</li>
    <li><code>features</code> are one or more space-separated IPA features (see the full list at the end of the page),
      each optionally preceded by the negator <code>^</code>, and</li>
    <li><code>phoneme</code> is an individual segment described in standard IPA notation (https://ipa.typeit.org/full/
      is used as a reference input system).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For example, a query asking for languages without lateral segments looks like <code>= 0 lateral</code> and a query
    to ask for languages with more than five voiceless affricates is <code>&gt; 5 voiceless affricate</code>. Each
    feature can be turned into its complement by using <code>^</code>. Thus, the query
    <code>&gt; 5 ^pre-nasalised voiced plosive</code> will return languages that have more than 5 oral plosives that are
    not pre-nasalised.
  </p>
  <p>The order of features does not matter. Some features (e.g., <code>nasalised</code>) are shared between vowels and
    consonants, and the words <code>vowel</code> and <code>consonant</code> can be used for disambiguation.</p>
  <p>Diphthongs, triphthongs, and click consonants have features <code>diphthong</code>/<code>triphthong</code> and
    <code>click</code> respectively assigned to them. Monophthong vowels have a feature <code>monophthong</code>, and
    non-click consonants have a feature <code>non-click</code>. Use these features to explicitly query for monophthong
    vowels and non-click consonants (the same goal can be achieved using <code>^diphthong ^triphthong vowel</code> and
    <code>^click consonant</code> respectively).
  </p>
  <p>Note that the negative value for <code>lateral</code> is inserted by default for approximants and the negative
    value for <code>nasal</code> is inserted by default for plosives. Thus, the query
    <code>= 0 voiced bilabial plosive</code> will ignore the presence of /m/ (voiced <em>nasal</em> bilabial plosive) in
    an inventory, but will not return languages with /b/. Likewise, the query <code>= 0 approximant</code> will skip
    languages with /w/ and /j/, but will ignore the presence of /l/ (voiced <em>lateral</em> alveolar approxumant). The
    query <code>= 0 fricative</code>, by contrast, will skip a hypothetical language whose fricative inventory consists
    of /ɬ, ɮ/.
  </p>
  <p>To make it easier to look for presence and absence of feature bundles and phonemes, two shortcuts are provided:
    <code>+</code>, equivalent to <code>&gt; 0</code>, and <code>-</code>, equivalent to <code>= 0</code>. E.g., a query
    for languages without /p/ looks like <code>- /p/</code>.
  </p>
  <p>Note that phoneme-based queries look for a symbol-by-symbol match. Thus, a language with /b, pʰ, pʼ/ will still
    satisfy the <code>- /p/</code> query and <code>+ /ɫ/</code> will not retrieve languages where this segment is
    denoted by /lˠ/.</p>
  <h3 id="comparison-queries">Comparison queries</h3>
  <p>Comparison queries make it possible to search for languages that have more or fewer segments of some kind compared
    to some other kind of segments. The basic form of the query is <code>operator features, features</code>, where
    <code>operator</code> and <code>features</code> have the same form as above.
  </p>
  <p>For example, languages with more vowels than consonants can be retrieved using <code>&gt; vowel, consonant</code>
    and languages with the same number of monophthong vowels and diphthongs can be queried by
    <code>= monophthong, diphthong</code> (use <code>= monophthong vowel, ^monophthong vowel</code> if you want to count
    all polyphthongs).
  </p>
  <h2 id="combining-queries">Combining queries</h2>
  <p>Sometimes basic queries are not enough. For example, in order to make basic queries simpler, the query language
    does not allow for querying nasal and oral plosives simultaneously. Therefore, in order to look for languages
    without both oral and nasal bilabial plosives it is necessary to combine two queries:
    <code>- nasal bilabial plosive and - bilabial plosive</code> (or, more explicitly
    <code>- nasal bilabial plosive and - ^nasal bilabial plosive</code>). This is also helpful to work around variations
    in IPA notation, e.g. <code>+ /g/ or + /ɡ/</code> (both the special /ɡ/ symbol and the basic Latin /g/ are
    officially recognised as part of IPA).
  </p>
  <p>Three logical operators are supported (in the order in which they are applied):</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>not</code> (return the complement of the query)</li>
    <li><code>and</code> (return the intersection of two queries)</li>
    <li><code>or</code> (return the union of two queries)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Parentheses can be used for clarity or to override the operator precedence order. Thus,
    <code>- /p/ and - /b/ or - /t/ and - /d/</code> is equivalent to <code>(- /p/ and - /b/) or (- /t/ and - /d/)</code>
    (<code>and</code> binds more tightly than <code>or</code>), but <code>- /p/ or - /b/ and - /t/ or - /d/</code> is
    not equivalent to <code>(- /p/ or - /b/) and (- /t/ or - /d/)</code>, but is instead equivalent to
    <code>- /p/ or (- /b/ and - /t/) or - /d/</code>.
  </p>
  <p><code>not</code> binds the most tightly, so it is necessary to use parentheses to invert any compound query.</p>
  <p>An example compound query:</p>
  <pre><code>not (
    (- /p/ or - /t/ or - /k/)
    and
    (- /b/ or - /d/ or - /g/)
) or
    &gt; 10 voiced affricate</code></pre>
  <p>Redundant whitespace is ignored.</p>
  <h2 id="features">Features</h2>
  <p>Canonical feature names are listed in the British orthography, but <code>ize</code>-spellings are supported as
    well. Note that not all possible features are listed for consonants and vowels but only those found in the database
    (see the <a href="https://github.com/macleginn/eurphon-parse-search/blob/master/ipa_parse_grammar.lark">complete
      list</a> in the parser grammar). E.g., all types of additional articulations are theoretically possible with both
    consonants and vowels.</p>
